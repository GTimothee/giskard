The NCA then informs the European Central Bank (ECB), which serves as the competent authority of the home Member State. The Joint Supervisory Team (JST) assesses whether the requirements for establishing the branch are met. If the requirements are fulfilled, a Supervisory Board proposal is prepared for approval. If the JST determines that the requirements are not met, a negative decision is prepared following the necessary procedures.&quot;,&quot;The main channels of political accountability for the ECB include regular hearings and exchanges of views in the European Parliament and the Eurogroup, providing records of proceedings to the European Parliament&amp;#x27;s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, addressing written questions from members of the European Parliament and the Eurogroup, and submitting a publicly available annual report to various entities including the European Parliament, the EU Council, the Eurogroup, the European Commission, and national parliaments of participating Member States.&quot;,&quot;The responsibilities of Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) in day-to-day supervision include drafting and organizing the Supervisory Examination Programme, conducting ongoing supervisory work at different levels, assessing an institution&amp;#x27;s risk profile, business model, and strategy, analyzing risk management systems, and performing on-site interventions if necessary. Additionally, JSTs analyze supervisory reporting, financial statements, and internal documentation of supervised entities, hold regular and ad hoc meetings with supervised entities at various staff levels, conduct risk analyses of approved risk models, and assess recovery plans of supervised entities. The key outcomes of these activities are summarized in the yearly Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) conducted by the JSTs.&quot;,&quot;The ECB is responsible for the direct supervision of significant institutions (SIs).&quot;,&quot;The Executive Board nominates the ECB heads of work units for decision-making powers.&quot;,&quot;If the Governing Council objects to a decision under the non-objection procedure, one of three procedures may be followed: Without comments from Supervisory Board members, with comments from Supervisory Board members, or if the Governing Council does not object.&quot;,&quot;The procedure for urgent supervisory decisions by the ECB that may adversely affect the addressee&amp;#x27;s rights involves a shortened process that allows the Supervisory Board to make necessary decisions in a timely manner. In urgent cases, the emergency procedure is triggered by a proposal from the JST, ECB management, and the NCA. This procedure can involve adjusting deadlines for written procedures, organizing quick Supervisory Board meetings, and even conducting meetings via teleconference. If a quorum for emergency situations is not met, an extraordinary meeting will be held shortly after. Additionally, the Supervisory Board may request a shorter deadline for the non-objection procedure of the Governing Council in emergency situations, which may convene immediately after a Supervisory Board meeting.&quot;,&quot;The focus of the second line of defence activities in ECB Banking Supervision is on supervisory outcomes rather than on compliance checks.&quot;,&quot;The JST may take supervisory action, such as issuing operational acts to the supervised entity, arranging meetings with the institution&amp;#x27;s management, proposing the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council, and incorporating the results into the risk assessment of the supervised entity for further analysis.&quot;,&quot;The annual review of supervisory priorities informs the strategic direction of ECB Banking Supervision for the next three years ahead.&quot;,&quot;A &amp;#x27;Medium-high&amp;#x27; risk score indicates a medium risk of a significant impact on the prudential elements of the group or its entities, given the inherent risk level.&quot;,&quot;The ECB acts as the consolidating supervisor in a supervisory college when it is responsible for overseeing the coordination and cooperation among authorities involved in the supervision of separate entities of cross-border banking groups and significant branches.&quot;,&quot;The national competent authorities (NCAs) are responsible for the direct supervision of less significant institutions (LSIs) within the SSM framework.&quot;,&quot;The three pillars of the European banking union are the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Single Resolution Mechanism, and the European Deposit Insurance Scheme.&quot;,&quot;JST coordinators in the Single Supervisory Mechanism are responsible for leading the Joint Supervisory Teams. They oversee the day-to-day supervision of significant institutions, coordinate with local coordinators from National Competent Authorities, and play a key role in tasks such as preparing and revising the Supervisory Examination Programme. Rotation of JST coordinators and members is expected on a regular basis to ensure effective supervision.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the holistic approach in the SREP is to capture an overall picture of an institution&amp;#x27;s risk profile that considers all relevant risks and their possible mitigants.&quot;,&quot;The Stress Test Experts Division within ECB Banking Supervision operates under specific conditions and responsibilities related to microprudential supervisory tasks. These include designing stress-testing methodology and templates, implementing quality assurance strategies for challenging institutions&amp;#x27; stress-test projections, supervising the development of models and IT infrastructure, collaborating with other divisions of the ECB, EBA, and/or NCAs, and providing sensitivity analyses and quantitative assessments for supervisory decision-making.&quot;,&quot;The European Central Bank ensures due process in its supervisory decisions by providing a clear motivation for the decision, including material facts, legal reasons, and supervisory considerations. It also grants the right to be heard to addressees of draft decisions, allowing them the opportunity to comment before final decisions are made.&quot;,&quot;The Independent Investigating Unit (IU) operates within the Enforcement and Sanctions Division to investigate breaches of directly applicable EU law, including ECB supervisory decisions or regulations, committed by significant institutions. The IU is responsible for carrying out investigations, granting significant institutions the right to be heard, and preparing a proposal to the Supervisory Board for a complete draft decision in cases where it considers an administrative penalty should be imposed.&quot;,&quot;A member of the management body of a significant institution can exceed the typical directorship limits in the following scenarios:\\\\n1. Directorships held within the same group or within institutions that are members of the same institutional protection scheme, or directorships held within entities in which the institution holds a qualifying holding.\\\\n2. Directorships in organizations that do not primarily pursue commercial objectives do not count towards the typical limits on directorships.&quot;,&quot;The ECB issues non-binding recommendations to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) as an alternative to binding guidelines in order to provide more flexibility. These recommendations may be specifically related to the supervision of LSIs or may extend the scope of existing recommendations addressed to SIs to include LSIs as well. They can be public or non-public and serve as a tool to communicate the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory approach to the public.&quot;,&quot;The absolute maximum duration, including any potential suspensions, for the formal assessment period for acquiring qualifying holdings in credit institutions is 60 working days. If additional information is requested during this period, the assessment may be suspended for up to 20 working days for regulated acquirers and up to 30 working days for unregulated acquirers or acquirers based in non-EU countries.&quot;,&quot;The guidelines for conducting on-site inspections can be found in section 4.7 of the Supervisory Manual. It is important to note that this section should not be confused with sections related to crisis management (section 4.9) or supervisory measures (section 4.10).&quot;,&quot;In the event of a critical supervisory decision required to prevent substantial harm to the financial system, the European Central Bank (ECB) may adopt a decision that affects the rights of the affected parties without allowing for prior comments. The hearing is postponed in such cases, and a clear justification for the postponement is provided in the decision. The hearing is then organized as soon as possible after the decision is adopted.&quot;,&quot;To invoke Decision ECB/2015/4, a supervised entity must submit a formal letter to the ECB using the relevant template and provide the information and documentation listed in the annex of Decision ECB/2015/4. The Joint Supervisory Team (JST) will then review the documentation to determine if it contains the required information, if the conditions outlined in the decision are met, and whether the credit institution can include interim or year-end profits in its CET1 capital.\\\\n\\\\nIf the conditions for Decision ECB/2015/4 are not fully satisfied or if the institution submits an application not covered by that decision, the JST will individually assess the request for permission to include interim or year-end profits in CET1 capital. This assessment will be conducted in line with either the standard decision-making procedure or the delegated procedure, as applicable.&quot;,&quot;In the context of the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory framework, the Steering Committee supports the activities of the Supervisory Board and prepares the Board&amp;#x27;s meetings. However, the Steering Committee does not have decision-making powers within the framework.&quot;,&quot;The Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of non-participating Member States aim to achieve the following objectives:\\\\n\\\\n1. Clarifying information exchange procedures.\\\\n2. Establishing consultation mechanisms.\\\\n3. Outlining cooperation procedures in emergency situations.\\\\n4. Facilitating ongoing supervision through joint meetings and cooperation on supervised entities.\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically in terms of information exchange and emergency cooperation, the objectives include facilitating a regular flow of confidential information between the signing authorities, clarifying information exchange procedures, establishing consultation mechanisms, and defining procedures for cooperation in emergency situations.&quot;,&quot;A Significant Institution (SI) looking to establish a branch in a non-participating Member State must follow these detailed steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Notify the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA) of the intention to set up the branch.\\\\n2. The NCA informs the European Central Bank (ECB), the competent authority of the SI&amp;#x27;s home Member State.\\\\n3. The Joint Supervisory Team (JST) assesses if the requirements for establishing the branch are met.\\\\n4. If requirements are met, the JST, with the SSM Secretariat Division, prepares a Supervisory Board proposal for approval.\\\\n5. The proposal is sent to senior management for consideration if it meets delegation criteria.\\\\n6. The Directorate General/Secretariat General Operations (DG/SGO) informs the host NCA within three months of a positive assessment outcome.\\\\n7. The host NCA specifies the conditions under which the branch activities can be conducted in the non-participating Member State.\\\\n8. If requirements are not met, a negative decision is prepared, approved by the Supervisory Board, and adopted by the Governing Council. The applicant institution is notified, and the home NCA is informed.\\\\n\\\\nThe host NCA may impose restrictions on the branch&amp;#x27;s operations based on national law and in the interests of the general good.&quot;,&quot;NCAs contribute to the formulation and scheduling of supervisory activities, especially concerning the organization of on-site missions, in a planning and staffing capacity. They work closely with relevant entities, providing most of the heads of mission and team members. The frequency of their contributions is determined by the specific needs and objectives of the supervisory activities, with on-site inspections being planned and staffed accordingly.&quot;,&quot;Prior to initiating a securitisation transaction to achieve recognition of significant risk transfer, originator institutions must undertake the following procedural steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Notify the ECB of their intentions at least three months before the expected closing date of the securitisation transaction.\\\\n2. Provide the final version of the documentation no later than 15 days after the closing date of the transaction.\\\\n3. The Joint Supervisory Team (JST) will assess the transaction and the credit risk transferred to third parties based on the documentation provided.\\\\n4. The JST may request any additional information necessary for their assessment.\\\\n\\\\nThese steps are essential for originator institutions to achieve recognition of significant risk transfer in securitisation transactions.&quot;,&quot;The European Court of Auditors (ECA) has limitations when auditing the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECA&amp;#x27;s audit powers are limited to examining the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB, specifically focusing on ECB Banking Supervision. The ECA can provide observations and recommendations to increase operational efficiency within this scope.\\\\n\\\\nThe ECA can provide recommendations or opinions regarding the ECB&amp;#x27;s operations when examining the operational efficiency of the ECB&amp;#x27;s management. Additionally, the ECA may issue opinions upon request from another EU institution. The ECB is required to provide necessary information for the audit and follow up on any recommendations made by the ECA.&quot;,&quot;During the hearing process in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Administrative Board of Review (ABoR) is responsible for chairing the hearings where the applicant, ECB representatives, and the applicant&amp;#x27;s representatives are present. The ABoR&amp;#x27;s Chair or Vice-Chair leads the hearings and may allow the applicant to call a witness or expert to provide oral evidence. Despite its opinion not being binding, the ABoR must adopt an opinion on the contested decision within two months of receiving the request and submit it to the Supervisory Board promptly.&quot;,&quot;The outcome of the SREP assessment is first communicated informally to significant institutions as part of the supervisory dialogue. Subsequently, the formal communication of the outcome is done through the resulting SREP decision.&quot;,&quot;When significant data quality issues are detected in the reports of a supervised entity, the JST can take supervisory actions such as issuing operational acts to the supervised entity, arranging meetings with the institution&amp;#x27;s management, proposing the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council, and incorporating the results into the risk assessment of the supervised entity for further analysis.&quot;,&quot;The ECB levies fees on all supervised entities in the euro area to cover the costs of its supervisory tasks. For financial conglomerates requiring cross-sector supervision, the fees are split into two categories: direct supervision fees for significant institutions directly supervised by the ECB, and indirect supervision fees for less significant institutions directly supervised by national supervisors. The fee for a supervised entity consists of a minimum fixed component and a variable component based on factors like the bank&amp;#x27;s size and risk profile, including risk-weighted assets.&quot;,&quot;The five criteria utilized by the ECB Guide to evaluate the fitness and propriety of members of the management body are:\\\\n\\\\n1. Experience\\\\n2. Reputation\\\\n3. Conflicts of interest and independence of mind\\\\n4. Time commitment\\\\n5. Collective suitability&quot;,&quot;ECB Banking Supervision contributes to the Financial Stability Board&amp;#x27;s objectives by being represented at the FSB Plenary, the single decision-making body of the FSB. Additionally, ECB Banking Supervision has been a member of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) since 2015. Through these roles, ECB Banking Supervision actively participates in coordinating the development of strong regulatory, supervisory, and financial sector policies, promoting international financial stability, and encouraging coherent implementation of these policies across sectors and jurisdictions.&quot;,&quot;Before entering into a proposed intragroup financial support agreement, a significant institution must take the following specific steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Apply for the ECB&amp;#x27;s authorization.\\\\n2. Notify the ECB and the EBA with a reasoned decision and details of the proposed financial support, including a copy of the relevant agreement.\\\\n3. The JST will assess compliance with the relevant provisions and forward the application to the competent authorities of each non-SSM subsidiary involved in the agreement for a joint decision.\\\\n4. Inform the Single Resolution Board about the authorized group financial agreements and any changes made to assess their impact on the group&amp;#x27;s resolvability.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a significant institution is part of a financial conglomerate requiring supplementary supervision, the specific steps include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Ensure coordination with the relevant competent authorities.\\\\n2. Submit all relevant information and requests to the supervisory authority, meeting the requirements set out in the legislation.\\\\n3. The coordinator for supplementary supervision, usually appointed from among the competent authorities, is responsible for coordinating and carrying out the supplementary supervision of the regulated entities in the financial conglomerate.\\\\n4. Conduct regular stress testing of the financial conglomerate in cooperation with other relevant authorities, avoiding duplication of sectoral supervision.\\\\n5. Seek permission from the competent authority if wishing to classify capital instruments as CET1 instruments, with the JST checking compliance with regulations and confirming the completeness of documentation.\\\\n6. Follow a specific notification procedure for subsequent issuances of instruments classified as CET1.\\\\n7. Include profits in CET1 capital with prior approval before a formal decision confirming the final profit or loss.&quot;,&quot;If a quorum of 50% is not met during a Supervisory Board meeting convened for an emergency situation, the procedural implication is that the meeting will be closed, and an extraordinary meeting will be held soon afterwards.&quot;,&quot;Ongoing model monitoring plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements in banking supervision by verifying a significant institution&amp;#x27;s adherence to internal model regulations. This monitoring involves assessing various aspects such as risk sensitivity, model validation, management of model risk, adaptations of the model, benchmarking, and overall processes related to the internal models. By conducting regular assessments and incorporating the information gained into the ongoing evaluation of the institution, ongoing model monitoring helps fulfill the regulatory requirements outlined in the CRD. Additionally, ongoing model monitoring involves off-site reviews, dedicated meetings with the supervised entity, and internal model investigations to identify any findings that may require corrective actions or further inspections. This continuous monitoring process ensures that institutions comply with internal model requirements on a regular basis, contributing to the overall effectiveness of banking supervision.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding potential non-compliance with Pillar 2 guidance for significant institutions in banking supervision, ongoing model monitoring helps address this by ensuring that the institution&amp;#x27;s internal models are in line with regulatory requirements, including risk sensitivity, model validation, management of model risk, and benchmarking. It involves regular assessments of the institution&amp;#x27;s compliance with legal requirements, supervisory conditions, and any remedial actions imposed by regulatory authorities. Additionally, ongoing model monitoring includes analyses of back-testing results, internal model validations, benchmarking outcomes, non-material model changes, and other internal reports to ensure that the institution&amp;#x27;s internal models are accurate and up-to-date. This continuous monitoring process helps detect any issues or deviations from regulatory standards, allowing supervisory authorities to take appropriate actions to address non-compliance and ensure the institution&amp;#x27;s adherence to Pillar 2 guidance.&quot;,&quot;The Independent Investigating Unit (IU) contributes to the enforcement process by conducting thorough investigations into breaches by significant institutions. The findings of these investigations provide valuable evidence that can be used by the ECB in enforcement actions, such as imposing periodic penalty payments on institutions found to be in breach. The IU&amp;#x27;s role is essential in ensuring that enforcement measures are based on solid evidence, thereby contributing to the integrity and stability of the financial system.&quot;,&quot;The suitability of an appointee to a management body can be affected by factors such as experience, reputation, conflicts of interest, independence of mind, and time commitment. These factors are assessed based on the individual&amp;#x27;s background, qualifications, ethical standing, ability to make independent decisions, and availability to dedicate sufficient time to the responsibilities of the role.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, management bodies are required to sign off on data quality issues identified in supervisory reporting.&quot;,&quot;Factors considered when determining the level of supervisory engagement for significant institutions, particularly in the context of cooperation between the ECB and NCAs, include:\\\\n1. Nature of appointments within the institutions\\\\n2. Fit and proper assessment process\\\\n3. Ongoing supervision conducted by Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs)\\\\n4. Support provided by the ECB&amp;#x27;s and NCAs&amp;#x27; horizontal divisions\\\\n5. Interactions facilitated through a dedicated digital platform (the Portal) for efficient information collection, assessment, and decision-making processes.&quot;,&quot;The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) provides financial assistance to euro area members experiencing or threatened by severe financing problems, if it is indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States.\\\\n\\\\nThe compliance requirements of the European Banking Authority&amp;#x27;s regulations for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) include fulfilling eligibility criteria, applying the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation fully, including its bail-in provisions, and ensuring effective cooperation and robust information flows between the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the ESM, and national resolution authorities in line with Article 3 of the SSM Regulation.\\\\n\\\\nThe European Stability Mechanism (ESM) considers the inclusion of CET1 capital instruments by assessing whether the relevant regulations are complied with and confirming if the capital instrument is listed in the EBA&amp;#x27;s public list of CET1 instruments. If the instrument is not listed, the ECB consults the EBA before making any decision. Additionally, subsequent issuances of instruments previously classified as CET1 may be included in CET1 capital following a specific notification procedure.&quot;,&quot;The potential outcomes of a SREP decision for significant institutions in case of identified breaches may include the imposition of additional supervisory measures, such as restrictions on business activities, requirements to reduce risks, limitations on dividend distributions, and increased reporting obligations. Additionally, the decision may involve the imposition of Pillar 2 requirements and guidance related to capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios to ensure sound management and coverage of risks by the institution.&quot;,&quot;The ECB ensures proportionality in urgent supervisory decisions by prioritizing individual institutions based on their risk profile and relevance. The intensity of oversight activities and resources allocated are tailored using a risk-based methodology that classifies institutions and sectors according to their riskiness and systemic impact. This approach allows the ECB to focus more intensely on institutions with higher risk profiles or those that could potentially cause significant damage to the financial system.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding time constraints in the fit and proper assessment of management bodies during urgent supervisory decisions, the ECB applies the principle of proportionality. This means that the application of suitability criteria is proportionate to the size and complexity of the entity and the role to be filled. While the standards of suitability cannot be lowered, a differentiated approach can be taken in the assessment process or the application of criteria. This may involve adjusting the level of knowledge, skills, and experience required or the time commitment expected from management body members. This individualized analysis and supervisory judgment ensure that time constraints are considered appropriately during urgent supervisory decisions.&quot;,&quot;The SSM Secretariat Division plays a crucial role in ensuring procedural integrity and supporting the Supervisory Board&amp;#x27;s activities by adopting procedural acts, notifying the addressees of these acts, preparing and following up on meetings and written procedures, drafting and reviewing proposals and decisions, assisting in preparing documentation for the Supervisory Board, advising on the decision-making process, liaising with the Secretariat of the Governing Council on decision-making processes related to the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory tasks, and supporting the preparation of Governing Council meetings on supervisory matters.&quot;,&quot;The benchmarking process in the SREP assessment ensures consistency and effectiveness in supervisory outcomes across different directorates such as DG/SIB, DG/UDI, and DG/SPL in ECB Banking Supervision by focusing on supervisors&amp;#x27; risk assessments, individual risk scores, and the overall SREP score. It also considers qualitative and quantitative factors, performs benchmarking across different peer groups to reflect business model specificities, and aligns with strategic priorities and the risk tolerance framework. This helps in identifying concerns that banks need to address and determining supervisory measures that are consistent across banks with similar vulnerabilities, ensuring that past measures are followed up in a timely manner.&quot;,&quot;The ECB ensures compliance with confidentiality and data protection standards when preparing a significance decision proposal for a branch from a non-participating Member State by conducting the supervision of the significant branch itself. If necessary, the ECB indicates the conditions under which the branch may carry out its activities in the host Member State. Additionally, the DG/SGO informs the relevant NCAs and the applicant institution about the decision, ensuring that the information is shared securely and in accordance with confidentiality and data protection regulations.&quot;,&quot;Data quality reports are typically produced twice for each production cycle of the STE data collection to ensure accurate and efficient information exchange.&quot;,&quot;The Directorate Supervisory Strategy &amp;amp; Risk (D/SSR) plays a crucial role in defining the ECB&amp;#x27;s banking supervision strategy. It sets supervisory priorities and establishes a risk appetite framework. Additionally, D/SSR supports the allocation of resources to these priorities, engages in discussions with the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) regarding supervisory outcomes, and proposes enhancements to supervisory policies, methodology, and standards.&quot;,&quot;You have one month from the notification of the ECB supervisory decision or from the applicant&amp;#x27;s knowledge to contest the decision before the ABoR (Administrative Board of Review).&quot;,&quot;The three components included in the simplified overview of the Supervisory Examination Programme (SEP) are:\\\\n1. Off-site activities\\\\n2. On-site activities\\\\n3. A list of data requests foreseen to take place over the course of the year.&quot;,&quot;An appointee or supervised entity can contest a decision made by the ECB by requesting a review by the Administrative Board of Review or by challenging the decision directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union.&quot;,&quot;To begin operating as a credit institution in a participating Member State in Europe, you will need to submit an application for banking authorization to the national competent authority of the Member State where the institution will be established. This application must comply with the relevant national legislation and be assessed to ensure that your entity meets both national and EU legal requirements to enter the market as a credit institution. Specific procedures for authorization will depend on whether your institution falls under the category of a classic credit institution or an investment firm meeting certain thresholds.&quot;,&quot;The Fit &amp;amp; Proper Division in the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory process is responsible for assessing the fitness and propriety of members of the management body against specific criteria such as experience, reputation, conflicts of interest, time commitment, and collective suitability. They ensure that individuals appointed to key roles in supervised entities have the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to fulfill their functions effectively. The division also considers the principle of proportionality, where the application of suitability criteria is adjusted based on the size and complexity of the entity and the role to be filled, without compromising the overall standards.&quot;,&quot;When a decision adversely affects the addressee in the ECB supervisory process, the addressee is granted the opportunity to comment before the decision is adopted. However, if the decision is urgent and necessary to prevent significant damage to the financial system, the ECB may adopt the supervisory decision without giving the addressee the opportunity to comment beforehand. In such cases, the hearing is postponed, and a clear justification for the postponement is provided in the decision. The hearing is then organized as soon as possible after the decision is adopted.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of setting the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SEP) in banking supervision is to cover tasks and activities related to ongoing supervision and on-site missions, in line with available resources. It helps in identifying and assessing key risks and vulnerabilities that affect entities under European banking supervision, forming a basis for defining supervisory priorities and guiding the everyday work of the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs).&quot;,&quot;The distribution of supervisory tasks between the European Central Bank (ECB) and national competent authorities within the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is determined by the significance of the supervised entities.&quot;,&quot;WCCAs (Written Cooperation and Coordination Arrangements) are cooperation arrangements between the consolidating supervisor and other competent authorities that formalize and govern relations within supervisory colleges. Their role is to provide a framework for planning and performing key supervisory tasks within the colleges of supervisors.&quot;,&quot;The ECB plays a coordinating role in crisis management for less significant institutions (LSIs). It ensures intensified information exchange and coordination among multiple stakeholders, including national resolution authorities and the Single Resolution Board. The ECB is also responsible for making decisions on common procedures, such as the withdrawal of banking authorizations, during crisis situations involving LSIs.&quot;,&quot;The Administrative Board of Review (ABoR) plays a crucial role in the supervisory decision review process by the European Central Bank (ECB). Its responsibilities include assessing the admissibility of the request, conducting a review based on the grounds provided in the application, and limiting its assessment to breaches of essential procedural requirements. The ABoR may also call for an oral hearing, adopt an opinion on the contested decision within two months, and provide recommendations to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board then submits a new draft decision to the Governing Council based on the ABoR&amp;#x27;s input and recommendations.&quot;,&quot;If you or your institution disagree with an ECB decision regarding your appointment as a fit and proper appointee, you have the following options:\\\\n\\\\n1. Request a review by the Administrative Board of Review.\\\\n2. Challenge the decision directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union.&quot;,&quot;Factors affecting the reputation of a member of the management body in a significant institution include personal or business conduct that raises doubts about their ability to ensure sound management, pending or concluded criminal or administrative proceedings, and conflicts of interest that may compromise their independence of mind.&quot;,&quot;On-site inspections in banking supervision serve the purpose of providing an in-depth analysis of banks&amp;#x27; situations, including risks, internal control systems, business models, and governance. These inspections aim to offer independent, consistent, and high-quality assessments that complement ongoing off-site supervisory activities.&quot;,&quot;The Supervisory Examination Programme (SEP) plays a crucial role in the supervision of significant institutions by the European Central Bank. Its purpose is to plan and outline regular supervisory activities related to ongoing supervision and on-site missions. The SEP helps in identifying and assessing key risks and vulnerabilities that impact entities under European banking supervision. It also defines supervisory priorities, guides the work of Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs), and ensures that supervisory activities are conducted in a risk-based and proportionate manner.&quot;,&quot;The ECB covers the costs of its supervisory tasks and annual fees for banks in Spain by levying an annual fee on all supervised entities in the euro area, which includes Spain. This fee consists of a minimum component and a variable component based on factors such as a bank&amp;#x27;s size and risk profile, including risk-weighted assets. The total amount of annual supervisory fees is published in an ECB decision by April 30 each year.&quot;,&quot;The Joint Supervisory Team (JST) plays a role in the process of authorisation for reducing own funds by ensuring that all necessary documentation is submitted by the institution. The JST has the authority to waive the submission of certain documents if the required information is already available. After assessing the request, the JST conveys a decision (positive or negative) on the request for reducing own funds, which is then communicated to the institution.\\\\n\\\\nPreapproval is not required for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).&quot;,&quot;The Governing Council is the ultimate decision-making body in the exercise of the ECB&amp;#x27;s tasks, including supervisory tasks. It is responsible for approving or objecting to complete draft decisions related to banking supervision under the non-objection procedure.\\\\n\\\\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for the planning and execution of the ECB\\\\u2019s supervisory tasks.&quot;,&quot;The ECB&amp;#x27;s Supervisory Board is responsible for the planning and execution of the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory tasks as outlined in the SSM Regulation. The board&amp;#x27;s approval is necessary for all draft supervisory decisions with legally binding effect before they are presented to the Governing Council for final adoption under the non-objection procedure.\\\\n\\\\nTo ensure the separation between its monetary policy and supervision functions, the ECB has an independent Supervisory Board that proposes draft supervisory decisions to the Governing Council. The Governing Council can adopt or object to the proposed decisions but cannot modify them. Deliberations on supervisory matters are kept strictly apart from those on other ECB functions, with separate agendas and meetings. Additionally, rules on information-sharing between the two functions are in place, requiring approval from the Executive Board for confidential information to flow between functions. Sharing of confidential raw data is done upon request and on a need-to-know basis, and policy functions do not disclose confidential information containing assessments or policy recommendations to the other function, except upon request and on a need-to-know basis.&quot;,&quot;The basis for the SREP 2023 assessment cycle is year-end data from the previous year, specifically data from 2022. The outcomes of the assessment cycle are formalized in the form of SREP decisions that are applicable to the following year. Therefore, the outcomes of the SREP 2023 assessment cycle are reflected in SREP decisions applicable to 2024.&quot;,&quot;A &amp;#x27;Medium-high&amp;#x27; risk score indicates a medium risk of a significant impact on the prudential elements of the group or its entities, given the inherent risk level.\\\\n\\\\nIn a risk control assessment, the following aspects are examined:\\\\n- The adequacy and appropriateness of an institution&amp;#x27;s internal governance/risk management\\\\n- The risk management and controls in place at the risk factor level\\\\n- How institutions monitor their risk exposures and identify necessary measures\\\\n- Assessing the adequacy of internal policies, organization, and limits\\\\n- Ensuring that category-specific risk control arrangements are consistent with the general internal governance/risk management at the institution level.&quot;,&quot;The role of the ECB in the authorisation process for Class 1 investment firms is to assess the application based on EU law requirements. The ECB may agree with or object to the NCA&amp;#x27;s draft decision, and its decision may include conditions, obligations, and recommendations for the applicant.\\\\n\\\\nIf a firm does not meet the requirements during the NCA&amp;#x27;s assessment, the firm&amp;#x27;s application will be rejected by the NCA.&quot;,&quot;Paragraph 209 of the Court of Justice&amp;#x27;s judgement in Joined Cases C-189/02 P and others states that internal measures adopted by the administration, although not considered as binding rules of law, are rules of practice that the administration must adhere to in individual cases unless valid reasons compatible with the principle of equal treatment are provided. These measures are seen as general acts, and officials and staff affected by them can challenge their legality in actions against individual measures based on them.\\\\n\\\\nThe Supervisory Manual was first published by the European Central Bank in March 2018. The revised version of the Manual, published in January 2024, reflects the most up-to-date information on European banking supervision, including the reorganization of ECB Banking Supervision that occurred in 2020.&quot;,&quot;The ECB has the role of requiring necessary information from legal or natural persons to carry out tasks conferred by the SSMR. This includes collecting supervisory data primarily from National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and specifying categories of information, processes, formats, frequencies, and time limits for reporting. Additionally, the ECB may require supervised entities to report additional supervisory information beyond what is harmonised by the EBA when necessary for carrying out supervisory tasks.\\\\n\\\\nRegular reporting is based on established frameworks and regulations such as the EBA reporting framework or ECB regulations/decisions, with detailed reporting requirements specified for institutions. Ad hoc reporting, on the other hand, involves collecting complementary data to meet specific needs, such as the Short Term Exercise (STE) for the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), tailored to Pillar 2 purposes and reviewed annually.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the SREP decision under the SSM Regulation is to issue a duly reasoned decision following a hearing, which includes setting out the total SREP capital requirement, institution-specific quantitative liquidity requirements, and other quantitative and qualitative supervisory measures. The decision aims to ensure sound management, coverage of risks, and transparency in European banking supervision.\\\\n\\\\nSome of the quantitative and qualitative supervisory measures that can be included in SREP decisions under the SSM Regulation are:\\\\n- Own funds requirements, including total SREP capital requirement and combined buffer requirements\\\\n- Institution-specific quantitative liquidity requirements, such as liquidity coverage ratio and survival periods\\\\n- Other quantitative measures like additional supervisory measures, Pillar 2 guidance, and leverage ratio requirements\\\\n- Qualitative measures that banks may be asked to implement to address specific circumstances and risks&quot;,&quot;The cooperation between the ECB and NCAs in the supervision of less significant institutions (LSIs) is crucial for effective oversight. This collaboration involves regular interactions in various formats and frequencies, such as online and on-site meetings at technical and middle management levels. Additionally, senior management workshops and conferences are scheduled regularly. Multilateral interactions, like senior management network meetings, where representatives of the ECB and all NCAs discuss and agree on supervisory topics concerning LSIs, are common. Other forms of cooperation may include joint supervisory activities, staff exchanges, and the exchange of information and data on NCA supervisory activities to facilitate the sharing of good practices.&quot;,&quot;The role of guidelines in the Single Supervisory Mechanism is to provide a framework for the functioning of the supervisory mechanism. Guidelines are legal acts that are binding with regard to the results that need to be achieved but allow for flexibility in their execution. They are particularly important for the ECB&amp;#x27;s indirect supervision of LSIs.\\\\n\\\\nThe due process requirements for ECB supervisory decisions include:\\\\n1. Sufficient motivation of the draft decision.\\\\n2. Granting the right to be heard.\\\\n3. Granting the right to access the supervisory file where necessary.&quot;,&quot;The emergency procedure for decision-making within the Single Supervisory Mechanism involves shortening the regular decision-making process to allow the Supervisory Board to make necessary decisions promptly. This procedure is typically initiated by a proposal from the JST, the management of the ECB, and the NCA. To expedite the decision-making process, deadlines for written procedures may be adjusted, and emergency Supervisory Board meetings can be quickly organized, including through teleconferences. If the required quorum for emergency situations is not met, the meeting will be closed, and an extraordinary meeting will be scheduled shortly after. In emergency situations, the Supervisory Board may also request a shorter deadline for the non-objection procedure of the Governing Council, which can even convene immediately after a Supervisory Board meeting.\\\\n\\\\nThe delegation framework in the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory tasks contributes to a more proportionate and efficient decision-making process by allowing clearly defined decision-making powers to be delegated to ECB heads of work units. This framework is established through a general framework decision, delegation decisions, and nomination decisions, which set out the criteria for the exercise of delegated powers for specific types of supervisory decisions. The delegation of decision-making powers ensures that a high number of draft supervisory decisions can be approved and adopted by the Governing Council every year, varying in complexity and impact on supervised entities.&quot;,&quot;The routine steps that follow supervisory activities and decisions in banking supervision include monitoring compliance and, if necessary, enforcement and sanctions. \\\\n\\\\nProportionality in supervisory engagement for European banking supervision is determined based on the risk profile and characteristics of the supervised entity. The level of supervisory engagement is linked to the institution&amp;#x27;s overall risk profile, size, complexity, and systemic impact. Differentiated levels of supervision are allocated based on these factors, ensuring that resources are allocated in a way that is both risk-based and proportionate to the type of institution being supervised.&quot;,&quot;The two categories of credit institutions defined by the CRR are \\\\&quot;classic credit institutions\\\\&quot; and \\\\&quot;Class 1 investment firms.\\\\&quot;\\\\n\\\\nFor a classic credit institution to be authorized to take up the business of a credit institution, an application for a banking authorization must be submitted to the national competent authority of the Member State in which the institution is to be established. This application is assessed to ensure that only entities that fulfill the applicable national and EU legal requirements enter the market as credit institutions.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the right to be heard in the supervisory process of the Single Supervisory Mechanism is to enable the addressee to react to the ECB&amp;#x27;s factual and legal analysis, ensuring that the ECB&amp;#x27;s decision-making is based on a complete set of information.\\\\n\\\\nIn an ECB supervisory procedure, the conditions for accessing the supervisory file include:\\\\n- Parties involved have the right to access the supervisory file before a decision that can negatively affect them is adopted.\\\\n- Access to the file is possible upon request from the opening of the supervisory procedure until the decision is final.\\\\n- This right is subject to the protection of the business secrets of third parties and does not extend to confidential information.\\\\n- The file is compiled by the business area in charge of drafting the supervisory decision concerned and is then reviewed for completeness before being notified to the applicant by the SSM Secretariat Division.&quot;,&quot;The SSM Secretariat Division plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory tasks. It supports and ensures efficient decision-making, guarantees the institutional quality of the decision-making process, adopts procedural acts on the conduct of the supervisory procedure, supports the Supervisory Board&amp;#x27;s activities by preparing and following up meetings and written procedures, drafts and reviews proposals and decisions, assists in preparing documentation for the Supervisory Board, advises on the decision-making process, liaises with the Secretariat of the Governing Council on decision-making processes related to the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory tasks, and supports the preparation of Governing Council meetings on supervisory matters.\\\\n\\\\nThe directorates general involved in the preparation of draft decisions for supervised entities in the ECB Banking Supervision are the Directorate General SSM Governance &amp;amp; Operations (DG/SGO) and the Directorate Supervisory Strategy &amp;amp; Risk (D/SSR).&quot;,&quot;The Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) are responsible for crisis preparedness and management in significant institutions. Their responsibilities include crisis prevention, early identification of crisis situations, assessment and operationalization of recovery plans, and consultation on resolution-related topics. The Crisis Team of the Division provides expert support to the JSTs throughout the crisis management process.&quot;,&quot;Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU requires banks and investment firms in the EU, which are subsidiaries of third-country groups, to establish a single intermediate EU parent undertaking under certain conditions. This requirement is triggered if the third-country group has two or more institutions within the EU with a combined total asset value of at least \\\\u20ac40 billion, including the assets of the third-country group&amp;#x27;s branches in the EU. This typically leads to restructuring within the third-country group, such as changes in control or the establishment of a new parent undertaking.&quot;,&quot;The ECB applies additional data quality controls to the data submitted by SIs in collaboration with the NCAs. These controls include regular monitoring, investigating unresolved issues from the first assessment, and conducting further checks like peer group analyses, plausibility checks, and comparisons across countries.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) between the European Central Bank (ECB) and market supervisors is to foster effective and efficient cooperation and facilitate a regular exchange of confidential information regarding credit institutions that are also supervised by the market authorities.&quot;,&quot;One important step that must be taken before entering into an intragroup financial support agreement is to apply for the ECB&amp;#x27;s authorization.&quot;,&quot;The main components of the EBA reporting framework include:\\\\n1. Common Reporting (COREP) and Financial Reporting (FINREP) frameworks\\\\n2. Liquidity Coverage Ratio\\\\n3. Net Stable Funding Ratio\\\\n4. Large Exposures\\\\n5. Leverage Ratio\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, the EBA reporting framework comprises all of the EBA\\\\u2019s Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), guidelines, and decisions on supervisory reporting.&quot;,&quot;The Independent Investigating Unit (IU) within the ECB&amp;#x27;s supervisory framework is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of directly applicable EU law, including ECB supervisory decisions or regulations, committed by significant institutions. The IU carries out investigations, grants significant institutions the right to be heard, and prepares proposals for the Supervisory Board in cases where it deems administrative penalties should be imposed.&quot;,&quot;The JST can take supervisory action if significant data quality issues are detected. This action may involve addressing the supervised entity directly through operational acts or arrangements with management. The JST could also propose the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council. Furthermore, the results of addressing data quality issues are likely to be incorporated into the risk assessment of the supervised entity for further analysis.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the ECB&amp;#x27;s breach reporting mechanism is to allow individuals to report suspected breaches of relevant EU law committed by supervised entities or competent authorities to the ECB in a protected manner, ensuring confidentiality and data protection standards are upheld.&quot;,&quot;The sources used for the assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in ECB Banking Supervision include direct access to Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) for institution-specific information, analyses conducted by other ECB business areas, stress-testing exercises, impact analyses of regulations, and selected thematic analyses.&quot;,&quot;The Supervisory Manual is a document that outlines the organizational structure of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and provides details on the methodologies, processes, and procedures for banking supervision in the euro area. It also explains how the SSM collaborates with other authorities within the broader institutional framework.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between the ECB and non-participating Member States&amp;#x27; NCAs is to clarify information exchange procedures, consultation mechanisms, and cooperation procedures in emergency situations.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of maintaining a continuous supervisory dialogue between Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) and supervised entities is to facilitate the early identification of risks, ensure timely implementation of corrective supervisory measures, foster a common understanding on key elements and main drivers of supervisory procedures (such as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP and supervisory stress tests), and encourage supervised entities to report ongoing and material developments in risks and markets in a timely manner.&quot;,&quot;The ECB plays an advisory role in the resolution process of a failing institution. It coordinates advice to the Single Resolution Board and national resolution authorities, authorizes a bridge bank, and may withdraw the institution&amp;#x27;s authorization if necessary. The Business Model, Capital &amp;amp; Crisis Division within the ECB also coordinates interactions with the Single Resolution Board and national resolution authorities during the resolution process.&quot;,&quot;If the JST concludes that the requirements for establishing a branch are not met, it prepares a negative decision under the non-objection procedure. The institution seeking to establish the branch is then granted the right to be heard in response to this decision.&quot;,&quot;The due process requirements for ECB supervisory decisions include providing sufficient motivation for the draft decision, granting the right to be heard, and allowing access to the supervisory file when necessary.&quot;]],[&quot;reference_answer&quot;,[&quot;A significant institution must obtain prior approval before including interim or year-end profits in its CET1 capital.&quot;,&quot;An SI wishing to establish a branch in a non-participating Member State has to notify the relevant NCA of its intention. Upon receipt of this notification, the NCA informs the ECB, which exercises the powers of the competent authority of the home Member State. The JST assesses whether the requirements for establishing a branch are met. If the requirements are met, the JST prepares a Supervisory Board proposal for taking note or a proposal to Senior management if the procedure meets the delegation criteria. DG/SGO informs the host NCA within three months of the positive outcome of the assessment, which then indicates to the applicant institution the conditions under which the activities of the branch can be carried out in the host Member State. If the requirements are not met, a negative decision is prepared by the JST, approved by the Supervisory Board, and adopted by the Governing Council under the non-objection procedure. The DG/SGO notifies the applicant institution of the negative decision and informs the home NCA.&quot;,&quot;The main channels of political accountability for the ECB include: 1. The Chair of the Supervisory Board attending regular hearings and ad hoc exchanges of views in the European Parliament and the Eurogroup. National parliaments can also invite the Chair or another member of the Supervisory Board, along with a representative from the respective NCA. 2. The ECB provides the European Parliament\\\\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with records of proceedings of all Supervisory Board meetings. 3. Members of the European Parliament and the Eurogroup can address written questions to the Chair of the Supervisory Board, with replies published on the ECB\\\\u2019s banking supervision website. National parliaments can also ask the ECB to respond to observations or questions. 4. The ECB submits a publicly available annual report to the European Parliament, the EU Council, the Eurogroup, the European Commission, and the national parliaments of participating Member States on how it has carried out its supervisory tasks.&quot;,&quot;The day-to-day supervision of SIs is primarily conducted off-site by the JSTs, which comprise staff from NCAs and the ECB and are supported by the horizontal and specialised expertise divisions of DG/HOL and similar staff at the NCAs. The JST analyses the supervisory reporting, financial statements and internal documentation of supervised entities. They hold regular and ad hoc meetings with the supervised entities at various levels of staff seniority and conduct ongoing risk analyses of approved risk models and assess the recovery plans of supervised entities.&quot;,&quot;The ECB acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that significant supervised entities comply with robust governance arrangements, including fit and proper requirements for management. It also has direct authority to exercise supervisory powers regarding the approval of key function holders and branch managers in significant institutions under national law.&quot;,&quot;The Executive Board nominates the ECB heads of work units for decision-making powers, having consulted the Chair of the Supervisory Board.&quot;,&quot;If the Governing Council objects to a decision submitted under the non-objection procedure, an NCA that is concerned by the decision and has different views may submit a request to the Supervisory Board for mediation. The objection will be dealt with by the Mediation Panel, which includes one member per participating Member State, chosen from among the members of the Governing Council and the Supervisory Board, and decides by simple majority, with each member having one vote.&quot;,&quot;In the case of an urgent decision necessary to prevent significant damage to the financial system, the ECB may adopt a supervisory decision without giving the addressee the opportunity to comment prior to its adoption. The hearing is postponed, and a clear justification is provided in the decision for the postponement. The hearing is then organised as soon as possible after the adoption of the decision.&quot;,&quot;They focus on supervisory outcomes rather than on compliance checks.&quot;,&quot;If the report shows significant data quality issues and, after a proportionate analysis, the JST detects violations of regulatory requirements, the JST takes supervisory action. Such action may take the form of an operational act addressed to the supervised entity or arrangements to meet the institution\\\\u2019s management. Alternatively, the JST could propose the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council.&quot;,&quot;The annual review of the supervisory priorities informs the planning of supervisory activities for the next cycle.&quot;,&quot;A &amp;#x27;Medium-high&amp;#x27; risk score indicates there is a medium risk of a significant impact on the prudential elements of the group or its entities, given the inherent risk level.&quot;,&quot;If the ECB is the consolidating supervisor, the JST coordinator is the chair of the college. The ECB discusses relevant topics with the NCAs within the JST in advance to present a common stance at college meetings.&quot;,&quot;The national competent authorities (NCAs) retain full responsibility for the direct supervision of less significant institutions (LSIs), in close collaboration with the ECB which is responsible for supervisory oversight.&quot;,&quot;The three pillars of the European banking union are: (i) the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), (ii) the Single Resolution Mechanism, and (iii) a European Deposit Insurance Scheme.&quot;,&quot;JST coordinators are responsible for leading each Joint Supervisory Team (JST) at the ECB. They are appointed for a period of three to five years and are expected to rotate regularly. They also prepare and revise the Supervisory Examination Programme and organize the allocation of tasks among JST members.&quot;,&quot;The holistic approach in the SREP aims to capture an overall picture of an institution\\\\u2019s risk profile that is as comprehensive as possible, considering all relevant risks and their possible mitigants. It involves examining the four elements of the SREP in combination to draw up the overall SREP assessment and prepare the SREP decision.&quot;,&quot;The Stress Test Experts Division is responsible for horizontal tasks involving microprudential supervisory stress testing.&quot;,&quot;Due process requirements include sufficient motivation of the draft decision, as well as the granting of the right to be heard and the right to access the supervisory file (where necessary).&quot;,&quot;The IU is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of directly applicable EU law, including ECB supervisory decisions or regulations, committed by significant institutions. It carries out investigations, grants significant institutions the right to be heard, and prepares a proposal to the Supervisory Board for a complete draft decision if it considers an administrative penalty should be imposed.&quot;,&quot;There are two exceptions: (i) certain multiple directorships count as a single directorship (&amp;#x27;privileged counting&amp;#x27;), i.e., directorships held within the same group or within institutions that are members of the same institutional protection scheme, or directorships held within entities in which the institution holds a qualifying holding; (ii) directorships in organisations which do not pursue predominantly commercial objectives do not count for the above limits.&quot;,&quot;Recommendations addressed to all NCAs are non-binding and serve as an alternative to the binding guidelines, allowing NCAs more flexibility. They may be specifically related to the supervision of LSIs or may extend the scope of an existing recommendation addressed to SIs to include LSI too.&quot;,&quot;The formal assessment period is a maximum of 60 working days from the acknowledgement of a receipt of a complete notification.&quot;,&quot;4.7&quot;,&quot;The ECB may adopt a supervisory decision which would adversely affect the rights of the addressee without giving it the opportunity to comment on the decision prior to its adoption. In this case, the hearing is postponed, and a clear justification is provided in the decision as to why the postponement is necessary. The hearing is then organised as soon as possible after the adoption of the decision.&quot;,&quot;A supervised entity must submit a formal letter addressed to the ECB using the relevant template and provide the information and documentation listed in the annex of Decision ECB/2015/4.&quot;,&quot;The Steering Committee supports the activities of the Supervisory Board and prepares the Board\\\\u2019s meetings. It is composed of a smaller group of Supervisory Board members and has no decision-making powers.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of this MoU is to clarify the information exchange procedures and, where relevant, the consultation mechanisms. It also sets out procedures for cooperation in emergency situations.&quot;,&quot;An SI wishing to establish a branch in a non-participating Member State has to notify the relevant NCA of its intention. Upon receipt of this notification, the NCA informs the ECB, which exercises the powers of the competent authority of the home Member State; in particular, the JST assesses whether the requirements for establishing a branch are met. If the requirements are met, the JST in liaison with the SSM Secretariat Division prepares a Supervisory Board proposal for taking note or a proposal to Senior management if the procedure meets the delegation criteria. DG/SGO subsequently informs the host NCA within three months of the positive outcome of the assessment, which then indicates to the applicant institution the conditions under which the activities of the branch can be carried out in the host Member State.&quot;,&quot;NCAs are regularly consulted with regard to the planning of supervisory activities and particularly with regard to the planning of on-site missions.&quot;,&quot;Originator institutions should notify the ECB of their intentions at least three months in advance of the expected closing date of the transaction and provide the final version of the documentation no later than 15 days after the closing date of the transaction.&quot;,&quot;The ECA&amp;#x27;s audit powers in relation to the ECB are limited to examining the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB. The ECA may submit observations, particularly in the form of special reports, which may contain recommendations on the functioning of ECB Banking Supervision to increase operational efficiency. The ECB provides the ECA with necessary information for the audit and follows up on its recommendations.&quot;,&quot;The ABoR may call for an oral hearing, which is chaired by the ABoR\\\\u2019s Chair or Vice-Chair and attended by the ABoR\\\\u2019s members and Secretary, ECB representatives, and the applicant\\\\u2019s representatives. The applicant may request permission to call a witness or expert to give oral evidence at the hearing.&quot;,&quot;The outcome of the SREP assessment is first communicated informally to the significant institution (as part of the supervisory dialogue) and then formally by means of the resulting SREP decision.&quot;,&quot;If significant data quality issues are detected, the JST can take supervisory action, which may include an operational act addressed to the supervised entity, arrangements to meet the institution\\\\u2019s management, or proposing the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council.&quot;,&quot;The ECB covers the costs of its supervisory tasks and responsibilities by levying an annual fee on all supervised entities in the euro area.&quot;,&quot;The fitness and propriety of members of the management body is assessed against five criteria: (i) experience; (ii) reputation; (iii) conflicts of interest and independence of mind; (iv) time commitment; and (v) collective suitability.&quot;,&quot;ECB Banking Supervision is represented at the Plenary, the single decision-making body of the FSB, and has been a member of the Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC) since 2015. It also participates as a supervisory authority in the Standing Committee on Standards Implementation (SCSI) since February 2017.&quot;,&quot;A significant institution must apply for the ECB\\\\u2019s authorisation before entering into a proposed intragroup financial support agreement.&quot;,&quot;If a quorum of 50% in the Supervisory Board for emergency situations is not met, the meeting will be closed and an extraordinary meeting will be held soon afterwards. The invitation letter to the extraordinary meeting should announce that the decisions will be taken without regard for the quorum.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of ongoing model monitoring is to verify a significant institution\\\\u2019s compliance with the regulatory requirements concerning internal models used for the calculation of minimum capital requirements pursuant to the CRR. It includes assessing the risk sensitivity of the model, validation, management of model risk, adaptations, processes surrounding the model, and benchmarking. The information gained is incorporated into the ongoing assessment of the institution and feeds into the SREP decision.&quot;,&quot;The IU is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of directly applicable EU law, including ECB supervisory decisions or regulations, committed by significant institutions. It carries out investigations, grants significant institutions the right to be heard, and prepares a proposal to the Supervisory Board for a complete draft decision if it considers an administrative penalty should be imposed.&quot;,&quot;Severe findings such as AML related issues, fraud, or other findings from on-site inspections or legal proceedings could impact the suitability of an appointee, even if there is no direct connection between the individual roles and responsibilities and the given findings.&quot;,&quot;Both the institution\\\\u2019s size and complexity are considered when determining the level of supervisory engagement for significant institutions.&quot;,&quot;The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) provides financial assistance to ESM members experiencing or threatened by severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States. It may also grant financial assistance to directly recapitalise financial institutions, provided that the eligibility criteria are fulfilled and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation is fully applied.&quot;,&quot;SREP decisions may include own funds requirements, institution-specific quantitative liquidity requirements, other quantitative and qualitative supervisory measures, and leverage ratio requirements and guidance under Pillar 2. These can involve a total SREP capital requirement, liquidity coverage ratio higher than the regulatory minimum, additional supervisory measures, and specific leverage ratio Pillar 2 requirements and guidance.&quot;,&quot;The ECB may adopt a supervisory decision which would adversely affect the rights of the addressee without giving it the opportunity to comment on the decision prior to its adoption. In this case, the hearing is postponed, and a clear justification is provided in the decision as to why the postponement is necessary. The hearing is then organised as soon as possible after the adoption of the decision.&quot;,&quot;The SSM Secretariat Division supports and ensures efficient decision-making, guaranteeing the institutional quality of the decision-making process. It adopts procedural acts on the conduct of the supervisory procedure and notifies the addressees of these acts. It also supports the Supervisory Board\\\\u2019s activities, which involves preparing and following up meetings and written procedures, as well as drafting and reviewing proposals and decisions. It assists all business areas in preparing documentation for the Supervisory Board and advises on the decision-making process. The SSM Secretariat Division liaises with the Secretariat of the Governing Council on all decision-making processes pertaining to the ECB\\\\u2019s supervisory tasks and supports the preparation of the Governing Council meetings on supervisory matters.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the benchmarking process in the SREP assessment is to support the JSTs and ensure consistency and effectiveness of SREP outcomes, based on a level playing field and the fair treatment of all supervised entities. It focuses on supervisors\\\\u2019 risk assessments, individual risk scores, the overall SREP score, and qualitative and quantitative factors. It helps determine supervisory measures that are consistent across banks with similar vulnerabilities and ensures past measures are followed up in a timely manner.&quot;,&quot;If the branch is significant, the ECB prepares a proposal for a significance decision. The supervision of the significant branch will be conducted by the ECB which, if necessary, indicates the conditions under which the branch may carry out its activities in the host Member State. DG/SGO informs the home NCA, the host NCA and the applicant institution.&quot;,&quot;Data quality reports are usually produced twice for each production cycle: once soon after the submission date and then again as a wrap-up report, usually six to eight weeks after the defined submission date.&quot;,&quot;The Directorate Supervisory Strategy &amp;amp; Risk (D/SSR) acts as a second line of defence, discussing supervisory outcomes with the JSTs and suggesting possible improvements of supervisory policies, methodology, and standards.&quot;,&quot;An ECB supervisory decision can be contested before the ABoR within one month of its notification or the applicant\\\\u2019s knowledge.&quot;,&quot;The simplified overview of the SEP comprises three components: 1. Off-site activities that the JSTs plan to perform in the forthcoming year, such as the SREP and &amp;#x27;deep dives&amp;#x27;. 2. On-site activities, such as on-site inspections and internal model investigations. 3. A list of data requests foreseen to take place over the course of the year (ad hoc and regular).&quot;,&quot;The appointee or the supervised entity has the option to request a review by the Administrative Board of Review or to challenge the decision directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union.&quot;,&quot;Institutions need to apply for a banking authorisation by submitting an application to the national competent authority (NCA) of the Member State in which the institution is to be established, in accordance with the requirements set out in the relevant national legislation.&quot;,&quot;The Fit &amp;amp; Proper Division acts as gatekeeper and is responsible for making decisions on the suitability of members of the management bodies of all entities directly supervised by the ECB, both in their management function and their supervisory function.&quot;,&quot;If the decision adversely affects the addressee, the final ECB supervisory decision is adopted after the addressee\\\\u2019s hearing period has expired, taking due account of the points raised by the parties.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of setting the SEP is to assess the relevance of each risk and the resulting risk tolerance, allowing supervisors to produce work programmes that consider supervisory priorities and the most pressing issues identified for the individual SI, ensuring efforts are directed to areas where supervisory action is viewed to be most effective.&quot;,&quot;The distribution of supervisory tasks between the ECB and national competent authorities (NCAs) within the SSM is determined by the significance of the supervised entities.&quot;,&quot;WCCAs are cooperation arrangements between the consolidating supervisor and the other competent authorities that formalise and govern relations within the supervisory colleges.&quot;,&quot;The ECB is the competent authority for taking decisions on common procedures, such as the withdrawal of banking authorisations. It may also increase its oversight activities, directly collect data, participate in or conduct on-site inspections, and become involved in direct supervision in specific cases to ensure high supervisory standards or if an institution&amp;#x27;s status changes from LSI to significant institution (SI).&quot;,&quot;The ABoR (Administrative Board of Review) may hold an oral hearing, adopts an opinion on the contested decision within two months, and submits it to the Supervisory Board. The opinion is not binding, but it precedes the Supervisory Board submitting a new complete draft decision to the Governing Council.&quot;,&quot;The appointee or the supervised entity has the option to request a review by the Administrative Board of Review or to challenge the decision directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union.&quot;,&quot;Pending \\\\u2013 as well as concluded \\\\u2013 criminal or administrative proceedings may have an impact on the reputation of the appointee and the supervised entity. Additionally, the personal or business conduct of an appointee that gives rise to any doubt about his or her ability to ensure the sound and prudent management of the credit institution can affect their reputation.&quot;,&quot;The purpose of on-site inspections is to provide an in-depth analysis of the situation of banks regarding topics such as risks, internal control systems, business models and governance.&quot;,&quot;The SEP covers the tasks and activities related to ongoing supervision and on-site missions, in line with available resources. It is a key part of identifying and assessing key risks and vulnerabilities that affect entities under European banking supervision, forming a basis for the definition of supervisory priorities and feeding into the everyday work of the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs).&quot;,&quot;The ECB covers the costs of its supervisory tasks by levying an annual fee on all supervised entities in the euro area.&quot;,&quot;The JST&amp;#x27;s role involves establishing that all relevant documentation has been submitted by the institution, as per Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 241/2014, and may waive submission of parts if the information is already available; the ECB makes the final decision on authorisation. As for preapproval, the CRR does not mandate it for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, but national law may require it, in which case the ECB can grant preapproval.&quot;,&quot;The Governing Council is the ultimate decision-making body in the exercise of the ECB\\\\u2019s tasks, including supervisory tasks, and can only approve or object to complete draft decisions under the non-objection procedure. The Supervisory Board is responsible for the planning and execution of the ECB\\\\u2019s supervisory tasks, and its approval is required for all draft supervisory decisions before submission to the Governing Council for final adoption.&quot;,&quot;The ECB&amp;#x27;s Supervisory Board proposes draft supervisory decisions to the Governing Council, which may adopt or object to the proposed decisions but cannot modify them, and the ECB ensures separation between its monetary policy and supervision functions by having separate agendas and meetings for supervisory matters, requiring Executive Board approval for information-sharing, and maintaining distinct staff elements across different directorates general and one directorate.&quot;,&quot;The SREP 2023 assessment cycle is based on year-end data for 2022, and its outcomes are formalized in the form of SREP decisions that are applicable to 2024.&quot;,&quot;A &amp;#x27;Medium-high&amp;#x27; risk score, which is a score of 3, indicates there is a medium risk of a significant impact on the prudential elements of the group or its entities, given the inherent risk level. A risk control assessment examines the adequacy and appropriateness of an institution\\\\u2019s internal governance/risk management and the risk management and controls in place at the risk factor level, including how institutions monitor their risk exposures, identify necessary measures, and evaluate the adequacy of their internal policies, organisation, and limits.&quot;,&quot;The ECB may agree with or object to the NCA\\\\u2019s draft decision regarding the authorisation of Class 1 investment firms, and its decision may include conditions, obligations, and recommendations for the applicant. If the NCA finds during its assessment that the Class 1 investment firm does not meet the requirements for authorisation as provided for in national law, it rejects the application.&quot;,&quot;Paragraph 209 states that internal measures, while not always binding rules of law, form rules of practice from which the administration cannot deviate without justification compatible with equal treatment, and officials may challenge their legality in individual cases. The Supervisory Manual was first published by the European Central Bank in March 2018, with a revised version in January 2024 reflecting the latest information on European banking supervision, including the 2020 reorganisation of ECB Banking Supervision.&quot;,&quot;According to the SSMR, the ECB should be able to require all necessary information and conduct investigations and on-site inspections, in cooperation with national competent authorities, without subjecting credit institutions to double reporting requirements. Regular reporting is based on the EBA reporting framework or an ECB regulation/decision, while ad hoc reporting (or complementary data collection) is based on supervisory decisions.&quot;,&quot;The SREP decision aims to ensure transparency and predictability of supervisory actions, allowing significant institutions to provide feedback before its conclusion, and it is taken under Article 16 of the SSM Regulation and must be duly reasoned. SREP decisions can include quantitative measures such as own funds requirements and institution-specific liquidity requirements, as well as qualitative measures like additional supervisory measures, Pillar 2 guidance, and leverage ratio requirements.&quot;,&quot;Open and ongoing cooperation between the ECB and NCAs is key for the effective and efficient supervision of LSIs, with regular interactions such as online and on-site meetings, workshops, and conferences. Examples of multilateral interactions include senior management network meetings, where representatives of the ECB and all NCAs gather to discuss and agree on relevant supervisory topics concerning LSIs.&quot;,&quot;Guidelines are legal acts addressed to NCAs that are binding with regard to the results that need to be achieved but allow for flexibility in terms of their execution, and they are important for the ECB\\\\u2019s indirect supervision of LSIs. Due process requirements for ECB supervisory decisions include sufficient motivation of the draft decision, as well as the granting of the right to be heard and the right to access the supervisory file where necessary.&quot;,&quot;In urgent cases, the emergency procedure within the Single Supervisory Mechanism involves shortening processes to allow timely decisions by the Supervisory Board, which may include adjusting deadlines or organizing meetings at short notice, even without a quorum. Simultaneously, the delegation framework contributes by allowing decision-making powers to be delegated to ECB heads of work units, ensuring a more efficient process, contingent on the Governing Council&amp;#x27;s adoption of a delegation decision and the Executive Board&amp;#x27;s nomination of relevant heads.&quot;,&quot;Supervisory activities and decisions are typically followed by routine steps such as the monitoring of compliance and, if necessary, enforcement and sanctions, while proportionality in supervisory engagement is determined by ensuring supervision is both risk-based and proportionate to the type of supervised entity, allocating resources based on risk profiles, size, and complexity.&quot;,&quot;The CRR defines credit institutions as either &amp;#x27;classic credit institutions&amp;#x27; that are authorised to take deposits or other repayable funds from the public and grant credits for their own accounts, or &amp;#x27;Class 1 investment firms&amp;#x27; that provide specific investment services and meet certain thresholds in terms of size at the individual or group level. For a classic credit institution to be authorised to take up the business of a credit institution, the procedure for authorisation as entrusted to the ECB applies to all activities reserved to classic credit institutions, including activities subject to mutual recognition under Annex 1 to the CRD and other regulated activities requiring authorisation from the competent authority under national law.&quot;,&quot;The right to be heard is a fundamental procedural right in the supervisory process, allowing the addressee to react to the ECB\\\\u2019s factual and legal analysis and ensuring that the ECB\\\\u2019s decision-making is based on a complete set of information. Parties involved in an ECB supervisory procedure have the right to access the supervisory file before a decision that can negatively affect them is adopted, subject to the protection of business secrets of third parties and not extending to confidential information.&quot;,&quot;The SSM Secretariat Division supports and ensures efficient decision-making, guaranteeing the institutional quality of the decision-making process. It adopts procedural acts on the conduct of the supervisory procedure, notifies the addressees of these acts, supports the Supervisory Board\\\\u2019s activities, prepares and follows up meetings and written procedures, drafts and reviews proposals and decisions, and liaises with the Secretariat of the Governing Council on all decision-making processes pertaining to the ECB\\\\u2019s supervisory tasks. The JSTs in DG/SIB, DG/UDI, and DG/SPL are the predominant originators of draft decisions addressed to supervised entities. DG/SGO and DG/SPL also originate draft decisions, mainly those relating to suitability assessments, sanctioning and enforcement decisions, common procedures, and proposals for general instructions concerning LSIs. DG/HOL and DG/OMI are involved in the decision-making process for on-site inspections and the issuance of new regulations, policies, and methodologies.&quot;,&quot;The JSTs, in close cooperation with the Business Model, Capital &amp;amp; Crisis Division, are responsible for crisis preparedness and management across different phases. They receive expert support from the Crisis Team of the Division, which shares expertise on processes established in the legal framework, early identification of crisis situations, assessment and operationalisation of recovery plans, and consultation on resolution-related topics.&quot;,&quot;Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU requires banks and investment firms in the EU that are subsidiaries of third-country groups to set up a single intermediate EU parent undertaking if the third-country group has two or more institutions established within the EU with a combined total asset value of at least \\\\u20ac40 billion, including the assets of the third-country group\\\\u2019s branches in the EU.&quot;,&quot;The ECB applies additional data quality controls such as peer group analyses, plausibility checks, and comparisons across countries to the data submitted by SIs.&quot;,&quot;MoUs between the ECB and market supervisors are intended to foster effective and efficient cooperation and facilitate a regular exchange of confidential information regarding credit institutions that are also supervised by the market authorities.&quot;,&quot;A significant institution must apply for the ECB\\\\u2019s authorisation before entering into a proposed intragroup financial support agreement.&quot;,&quot;The main components of the EBA reporting framework mentioned are the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting, guidelines, and decisions on supervisory reporting. It includes detailed reporting requirements concerning own funds and financial information, such as the common reporting (COREP) and financial reporting (FINREP) frameworks, the liquidity coverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, large exposures, and the leverage ratio.&quot;,&quot;The IU is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of directly applicable EU law, including ECB supervisory decisions or regulations, committed by significant institutions. It carries out investigations, grants significant institutions the right to be heard, and prepares a proposal to the Supervisory Board for a complete draft decision if it considers an administrative penalty should be imposed.&quot;,&quot;If the report shows significant data quality issues and, after a proportionate analysis, the JST detects violations of regulatory requirements, the JST takes supervisory action. Such action may take the form of an operational act addressed to the supervised entity or arrangements to meet the institution\\\\u2019s management. Alternatively, the JST could propose the use of supervisory powers to the Supervisory Board and the Governing Council.&quot;,&quot;The ECB&amp;#x27;s breach reporting mechanism allows anyone who, in good faith, suspects that a breach of relevant EU law has been committed by a supervised entity or a competent authority to report it to the ECB. The report is treated as a protected report with personal data duly protected in compliance with confidentiality and data protection standards.&quot;,&quot;The assessment uses a wide range of sources, in particular the risk-specific analyses conducted by the horizontal functions of ECB Banking Supervision, the outcomes of the annual ECB stress test and the SREP, as well as institution-specific information through the JSTs. Relevant developments in the economic, regulatory and supervisory environment and insights from the market intelligence activities of D/SSR also provide important additional input for the preparation of the assessment.&quot;,&quot;January 2024&quot;,&quot;The purpose of the MoU is to clarify the information exchange procedures and, where relevant, the consultation mechanisms. It also sets out procedures for cooperation in emergency situations.&quot;,&quot;Maintaining a continuous supervisory dialogue is very important for the early identification of risks and the timeliness of corrective supervisory measures. It also fosters a common understanding between supervised entities and supervisors on the key elements and main drivers of the outcome of supervisory procedures, such as the SREP and supervisory stress tests.&quot;,&quot;Within the resolution process, the ECB, through the JSTs and the Business Model, Capital &amp;amp; Crisis Division, predominantly plays an advisory role. The Business Model, Capital &amp;amp; Crisis Division coordinates the advice to the Single Resolution Board/national resolution authorities at the resolution stage and necessary follow-up actions, such as the authorisation of a bridge bank and the withdrawal of the residual institution\\\\u2019s authorisation, where necessary. The JST may provide additional advice on the potential business model implications of the various resolution options.&quot;,&quot;If the JST concludes that the requirements are not met, it prepares a negative decision under the non-objection procedure and the SI is granted the right to be heard.&quot;,&quot;Due process requirements include sufficient motivation of the draft decision, as well as the granting of the right to be heard and the right to access the supervisory file (where necessary).&quot;]],[&quot;id&quot;,[162,99,8,75,128,40,27,34,80,117,71,150,50,191,5,14,147,123,31,183,134,30,91,2,34,163,24,46,99,72,167,63,45,145,117,20,130,67,165,39,159,184,131,119,62,155,34,25,154,98,112,69,44,120,137,82,75,28,72,6,48,198,45,136,132,77,118,21,164,22,10,144,150,87,4,109,155,193,31,38,119,83,33,25,172,169,116,55,166,110,183,117,186,71,0,54,138,177,96,32]],[&quot;content&quot;,[&quot;If necessary, \\\\nadditional information is requested.
